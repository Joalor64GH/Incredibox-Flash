# Incredibox (Flash Version)
A fan recreation of Incredibox when it first appeared on Flash!

It's basically an archive of the flash versions of Little Miss, Sunrise, The Love, and The Original. <br>
I also copied a few other elements from the old website just for fun. <br>
If something goes wrong, you can either [contact me](rhgarcon@gmail.com) or [report an issue](https://github.com/Joalor64GH/Incredibox-Flash/issues). <br>
Enjoy!

## Known Issues
* In The Original, when you deselect a sound, the game becomes unplayable.
    * This means that sounds stop playing, animations won't play when you put down a sound, and selecting a bonus does nothing.
    * Additionally, the bonuses have no sound for some reason.
* V1: Alpha is currently unavailable at the moment. If the assets are found, they will be added here.
